# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview
The example company, PyBer, wants to generate some ride sharing data analysis and visualizations to display relationships between drivers, riders, and the type of city they are in. Specifically, PyBer is interested in the percentage of total fares, drivers, and riders all by city type. 
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to combine all of the ride sharing data found previously into a summary dataframe for Pyber to review. The data will be organized by city type. Then, PyBer wants to review all of the different cities' total fares over the past few months. All of these objectives will be analyzed and visualized. These visualizations will be used to evaluate ride sharing in the different city types and also the trends of each city type so PyBer will know what kinds of cities are most profitable for the company.

# Results
## Ride Sharing Data
Some of the analysis was done during the module, meaning that the dataframes with the ride data and city data were merged into a single dataframe. From this single dataframe, the total number of riders, total number of drivers, total amount of fares for each city type were able to be calculated. Then, the average fare per rider and per driver for each city type was calculated. A larger summary dataframe was created to organize all of this data: (insert image***)

According to the analysis done on the ride sharing data, there were substantially more riders, more drivers, and higher
